      "This is amazing work and clearly you've put a lot of time and effort into these great job man. But in saying that I do have to agree with the other posters concerning the boobs. I'm sure you didn't intend any offense but what it seems like you have done is fallen into a trap that has been plaguing fantasy and sci-fi armour design for decades now. The idea of adding boobs and taking away other parts to show more skin. \"Sexy atmour\" if you will. When in reality female armour was and is a real thing and the only real differences were and are the fit of the armour. Just my two cents. Like I said the craftsmanship and pieces themselves are amazing\n",

      "Ohhh man seriously circles are THE WORST. So hard to cut accurately.  \n",
      "Heat shaping is the best way to go. I usually cut a a little pie slice out of it and glue that to make it work better. But if you hear it with a heat gun and then press it over a spherical object ( I just used a foam sphere I bought at a craft store) \n",
      "That works a treat! \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks mate!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah I do know what people mean, mainly I was just following the Batman vibe from the games/comics and adding my own twist. But I certainly didnâ€™t take away parts to add skin. Itâ€™s basically covers everything! I did want the shape to be more feminine, but mainly just to distinguish the two. (And because my wife liked it that way!)  I appreciate the thoughts and comment though! Cheers man! \n",

The idea of breast on arm does in reality cause potential for say a sword to catch on the external armor and act as a guiding for a stab or even cleave of a larger sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most armor in reality was bubbled out to act as a pillow like crumple zone for blows as well as a way to deflect blows as well, one continuous rounded full out chest plate would defect blows away from the chest like a bubble of protection with over lapped shoulders to keep it from catching or going into the arm pit.\n",
